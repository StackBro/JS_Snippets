git init
git add README.txt //or some else, if need to add all files, you can use command: git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
git branch -M main //if you in this brach, you don't need to execute this command
git remote add origin https://github.com/StackBro/JS_Snippets.git //if already exist, you don't need to do this step
